gdropR
================

The gdropR package provides a very simple, lightweight wrapper that sets
up input files to the software program
[Mendel](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23610370/) to allow simulation
of linked markers on a user-defined pedigree.

Unfortunately, Mendel does not seem to be distributed any longer. So, if
you need it, ask Eric.
