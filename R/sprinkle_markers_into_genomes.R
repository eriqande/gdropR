#' Randomly distribute markers along the chromosomes of a genome
#'
#' If you have a bunch of markers, but you don't know where in the genome
#' they are, BUT you have an idea of how big the genome is and how many
#' chromosomes are in it, this will place your markers uniformly within
#' the length of the genome.  This will let you assess how much of an effect
#' the physical linkage might have on pairwise relationship inference.
#' @param markers A tibble of markers and allele frequencies like `markers40`. It
#' should have the columns Chrom, Locus, Pos, Allele, LocIdx, AlleIdx, and Freq,
#' AND it must have been run through `reindex_markers()`.
#' @param genome A tibble like that in the
#' `chromo_lengths` component of the list returned by `geometric_chromo_lengths()`. It
#' must have the columns idx, chrom, scaled_length, num_bases.
#' @return This returns a tibble that is of the same format as `markers`, but the positions
#' of the markers have been simulated uniformly into the length of the genome in `genome`.
#' Note that the `Locus` column in `markers` is retained as the name of each locus.
